# Text-to-Speech (TTS) Application

## Overview

This application is a Text-to-Speech (TTS) tool that uses Google Cloud's Text-to-Speech API to convert copied text to speech. It allows users to select different voices, adjust the speaking speed and volume, and bind a hotkey for quick text-to-speech conversion.
